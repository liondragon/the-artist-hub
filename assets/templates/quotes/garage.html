<h2>Excellence at Every Step</h2>
<h3>Better Prep = A Floor That Lasts</h3>
<p>Despite claims to the contrary, most installers use grinders that only reach CSP 1 or 2 - below what epoxy
	manufacturers <em>recommend</em> for proper adhesion. We use industrial shotblasting to achieve a <strong>true CSP
		3</strong>, as required by leading epoxy coating systems. That means better bonding, longer-lasting floors, and
	no peeling down the road.

<h3>Repairs</h3>
<p>After shotblasting, we repair all cracks, pits, and spalled areas using high-performance materials. This restores the
	concrete’s integrity and ensures a smooth, even surface ready for coating.</p>
<p>We take prep seriously - over half of our on-site time goes into surface preparation and repairs, because that’s what
	ensures a floor that lasts and lives up to your expectations.</p>

<h3>No 1-Day Floors</h3>
<p>We prefer urethane cement for our base coat, surpassing the limitations of the quick-drying polyurea polyaspartic
	alternatives commonly used today. Despite a longer curing time, its benefits are clear: a significantly stronger
	bond with concrete, superior moisture tolerance, and exceptional thermal shock resistance.</p>

<h3>High Performance</h3>
<p>While polyaspartic may not be the preferred choice for a base coat, it stands out as a top coating, being up to six
	times stronger than traditional epoxy. It is fully UV stable and fade-resistant. This synergy ensures our flooring
	solution withstands hot tire pickup and resists salt damage, ensuring exceptional durability and performance.</p>

<h3>Unique Designs</h3>
<p>Offering virtually limitless color combinations, we provide unique and custom options to meet your design needs</p>

	card transactions.</p>
