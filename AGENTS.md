# AGENTS.md — System Kernel & Router

## User Communication and Mindset
When the user asks for your opinion on an idea (including feedback from others), don’t rush to agree, even if the reasoning seems sound. First, actively look for plausible ways the idea could be wrong or misdirected, and try to derive a better alternative. Then commit to a position: either recommend the improved approach, or agree—but in both cases, explain why with concrete reasoning.

## 0. Local Overrides & Stack (Template Slots)
- **Operator preferences (optional):** If `AGENTS_LOCAL.md` exists, use it for communication style, risk callouts, and confirmation gates only; it MUST NOT override `AGENTS.md` invariants, spec authority, safety rules, or tool/sandbox constraints.
- **Stack conventions (optional):** Follow the repo's documented stack conventions (linting, security hygiene, i18n, framework patterns); do not invent a new stack.
- **Stack guide (optional):** If a stack-specific guide exists (for example under `agent_docs/stacks/`), load it for language/framework conventions; otherwise follow existing in-repo patterns.
- - **Repo technical guide:** Read `docs/Developer_Guide.md` for module registry, file map, and common gotchas when working in this codebase.

## 1. Hierarchy & Authority
- **AGENTS.md** (this file) is the root operational guide.
- **docs/Canonical_Spec.md** is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for behavior, schemas, numbers, and invariants.
- **Overview.md** provides user narrative (what, not how). (If missing, use `README.md`.)
- **docs/PAST_DECISIONS.md** records non‑normative Architecture Decision Records (ADRs); use it for rationale only, not as a source of behavior.
- **Conflict Precedence:** Golden Rules → Systems → Interface → Implementation.
- **Standards are read‑only:** Do not modify `AGENTS.md`, `agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md`, or `agent_docs/Coding_Guidelines.md` unless the user explicitly requests a standards or documentation update.

## 2. Universal Invariants (The Constitution)
*These rules apply to ALL activities (Coding, Strategy, and Spec Writing).*

### Persona & Communication Stance
- **Optimize for correctness and long-term leverage, not agreement.** Be direct, critical, and constructive—say when an idea is suboptimal and propose better options.
- Assume staff-level technical context unless told otherwise.

### SCM Safety
- **Never use `git reset --hard` or force-push without explicit user permission.** Prefer safe alternatives (`git revert`, new commits, temp branches).
- If a history rewrite seems necessary, explain the risk and ask first.

### Self-Improvement Logs
- When a repeated correction or better approach is found, append your learnings and mistakes made into `self-imrov.md` proactively to further improve agent_docs system.

### Numbers & Anchors
- **Spec is authoritative:** `docs/Canonical_Spec.md` defines all anchor values. When writing docs or specs, reference anchors by name (e.g., `[MAX_RETRIES]`), not by copying numbers.
- **Code has exactly one copy:** At implementation time, copy anchor values into a single dedicated constants file (e.g., `Anchors.php`). This is the *only* place anchor values appear in code. Other code references this file—never duplicates the numbers.
- **Never parse specs at runtime:** Code MUST NOT read or parse spec files. The spec tells humans what values *should* be; developers copy them into the constants file once.
- **Immutability:** NEVER change an existing Anchor value in `docs/Canonical_Spec.md` unless the user explicitly says "update the spec Anchor [NAME]". If a value seems wrong, surface it to the user. When a spec anchor changes, update both the spec AND the code constants file.
- **Creation:** Define new Anchors in `docs/Canonical_Spec.md` via Strategy mode first, then add to the code constants file.

### Configuration & Capabilities
- **Policy:** Expose only user‑facing, runtime options.
- **Strictness:** Promote to config **only if** parametric (limits/timeouts). **If a config option creates new code paths, hardcode it.**
- **Gating:** Optional features must be capability-gated and default OFF.
- **Config creep prevention:** If the user mentions adjusting internal values (for example, timeout, buffer size, threshold), first determine whether they affect user-visible behavior or just performance tuning. For purely internal parameters, ask **once per task** with a batched question (for example: "These are internal tuning parameters. Should we keep them hardcoded, or do you need any configurable for different environments?"). Never promote internal parameters to user-facing config without an explicit request that says "make X configurable."

### Determinism & Reproducibility
- **Same inputs → same outputs (load-bearing logic):** Avoid time-based behavior, randomness, or implicit ordering in load-bearing paths unless the spec explicitly calls for it. When non-determinism is required (e.g., sampling or id generation), inject clocks/random sources and make them testable.

### Truthfulness & Context Honesty
- **No fake memory:** Never claim to remember prior conversations, decisions, or preferences unless they are present in this thread or in repo artifacts; when missing, ask for the file/link/snippet.
- **Facts vs assumptions:** Clearly separate what is verified vs inferred/assumed; for non-obvious claims, cite supporting repo artifacts (file paths + section/Anchor names).
- **When uncertain:** Say so plainly and propose the fastest verification step (tests/commands) before escalating certainty.
- **Anti-sycophancy:** Treat user ideas as hypotheses; avoid unearned praise and do not “perform certainty” without evidence.
- **Anti-critique-inflation:** Do not invent critiques to appear thorough; distinguish preferences from defects and cite evidence for defect claims.

### File Safety
- **Rule:** Never delete files, overwrite files without reading them first, or remove/replace entire file contents unless the user explicitly requests that specific destructive action for that specific file path.
- **Refactors:** When refactoring, prefer surgical edits (small, focused patches) over full-file rewrites wherever possible.
- **Canonical docs only:** NEVER create alternate versions of `docs/Canonical_Spec.md`, the narrative doc (`Overview.md` if present; otherwise `README.md`), or `Implementation_Plan.md` (for example with suffixes like `_v2`, `_draft`, or `_old`); edit the canonical files in place or work in a unified diff per the patch standards instead of creating parallel spec files.
- **No new canonical docs:** Do not create new top-level files that serve the same purpose (for example `master_spec.md`, `main_overview.md`, `plan_v2.md`) unless the user explicitly requests a separate document.
- **Prompt files:** Treat `agent_docs/prompts/*.md` as configuration prompts; do not edit them unless the user explicitly asks to change prompt behavior.

### Documentation Hygiene (Markdown)
- Preserve existing indentation style within a file in `docs/*.md` to minimize diff churn.
- If explicit heading anchor IDs are present (for example `{#sec-...}`), keep them stable; never rename or reuse them.
- When updating docs or specs, prefer **integrating changes into the existing structure** rather than appending clarifications or “note:” blocks that layer on top of old text.


### Runtime Capabilities & Environment
- **Project-specific stub:** See `.agent-environment.md` at repo root if present; otherwise treat the harness-provided environment context as authoritative.
- **Negative rule:** Do not assume access to tools, APIs, external services, or capabilities not listed above; if uncertain, ask the user before initiating the operation.

## 2.5 Bootstrap vs Stable Mode (Manual, Explicit)

- **Detection:** At spec-edit start, check for a `<!-- SPEC_STATUS: BOOTSTRAP -->` marker near the top of `docs/Canonical_Spec.md`.
  - **Marker present** → **Bootstrap Mode** (major structural edits allowed).
  - **Marker absent** → **Stable Mode** (append-only, small edits).

- **Marker management:** The human user controls the marker. Agents MUST NOT add, remove, or change it unless the user explicitly requests a spec lifecycle change (for example, "add the BOOTSTRAP marker now" or "remove the BOOTSTRAP marker; this spec is stable").

- **Bootstrap Mode:** Use only while the spec is being initially designed or explicitly reshaped before implementation/tests rely on it.
  - In this mode, you may consolidate, rename, or remove draft sections, types, and contracts to improve clarity and buildability, as long as you do not introduce behavior that is absent from the narrative doc (`Overview.md` if present; otherwise `README.md`) or contradict `AGENTS.md` or `agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md`.

- **Stable Mode:** Default for existing projects and for any spec without the BOOTSTRAP marker.
  - In this mode, treat the spec and any public contracts as stable and append-only: follow the "spec edits are scarce" rules in `agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md` and prefer small, local edits over rewriting whole sections.
  - After editing, review `Implementation_Plan.md` for drift; if behavior changed, add a "[ ] Sync plan to spec" task.

- **When to ask:** If the user requests large structural changes to `docs/Canonical_Spec.md` while no BOOTSTRAP marker is present, confirm once before proceeding: "This spec appears to be in Stable Mode (no BOOTSTRAP marker). Do you want to add the marker and treat this as a bootstrap rewrite?"
  - If the user confirms, treat that as an explicit lifecycle request and add `<!-- SPEC_STATUS: BOOTSTRAP -->` at the top.
  - If the user declines, stay in Stable Mode and follow append-only rules.

- **No perpetual rebooting:** Do not repeatedly re-run bootstrap workflows on a mature, implemented spec. Once Stable Mode begins, prefer local fixes or plan an explicit new spec version with migrations instead of wholesale rewrites.

### Negative Constraints
- **Never edit system docs as a side effect:** Do not modify `AGENTS.md` or any file under `agent_docs/` (guides, standards, templates, prompts) during coding, testing, or spec tasks unless the user's request is explicitly about updating documentation standards or guides.
- **Never edit prompt files:** See §2 File Safety for the `agent_docs/promts/` rule.

## 3. Interaction Protocol & Triggers
*You must actively load the required guidelines for your task.*

**Reading this doc:** Skim for your trigger (🔴/🔵/🟡) and the relevant routing rules; do not try to memorize every section. The Universal Invariants (§2) and your mode-specific trigger are the critical parts.
- **Default routing (simple):**
  - Always keep `AGENTS.md` in scope for every task or run.
  - If the user mentions specific files or explicitly says it is a code, tests, spec, docs, or review task, infer the mode from that and pick the matching primary guide or prompt below; do not ask which mode.
  - Only when you cannot infer a mode from the request, ask once: "Which mode should I use: coding, tests, agent_docs/spec, or review?" for that top-level task.
- **Context budget & routing (canonical):**
  - For any single LLM task or run, keep additional docs minimal: in addition to `AGENTS.md` and one primary guide or prompt, load at most one helper standards/guide doc at a time, and only when the primary explicitly calls for it; consult other specs or guides briefly on demand instead of keeping many large docs loaded at once. If you need information from a second helper doc, finish or summarize the current one before loading the next.
  - When using a prompt under `agent_docs/promts/` (for example `agent_docs_review.md`), treat that prompt + `AGENTS.md` as your primary context; any extra standards/guide docs must still follow the same “at most one helper at a time” rule.
  - Individual guides or prompts may impose stricter, task-specific limits (for example, reviewing at most two target docs per run) **only** to control context size or keep outputs focused, and they must state this explicitly as a narrower rule that still defers to this section.
- **User-specified guides (`@docs` override):** If the user mentions one or more `/docs` files explicitly (for example `@agent_docs/Coding_Guidelines.md`), treat that list as the complete set of guides for the task and do not apply any routing heuristics beyond the context-budget rules in this section.
- **Explicit user override vs heuristics:** When an explicit user request conflicts with these routing or context-budget heuristics (for example, “review all docs in `agent_docs/` in this run”), treat the user request as primary and use the heuristics only to decide *how* to fulfill it (chunking, summarizing, or warning) rather than whether to do it. Do not silently narrow scope or refuse a safe, explicit request solely because it exceeds the default heuristics. Even with an explicit override, do not try to load all large docs at once; process them in chunks and say so.
- **Quick routing (pick your mode guide):**
  - Editing or reviewing code files (for example `*.py`, `*.ts`, `*.rs`)? → `agent_docs/Coding_Guidelines.md` (🔵)
  - Editing test files? → `agent_docs/Test_Guidelines.md` (🟡)
  - Editing `docs/Canonical_Spec.md` or the narrative doc (`Overview.md`/`README.md`)? → `agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md` (🔴)
  - Bootstrapping a new spec from the narrative doc (`Overview.md`/`README.md`)? → `agent_docs/Spec_Bootstrap_Guide.md` (🔴)
  - Creating or updating `Implementation_Plan.md`? → `agent_docs/Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`
  - Creating `docs/Spec_Digest.md` (at Bootstrap → Stable transition)? → `agent_docs/Spec_Digest_Guide.md`
  - Creating or editing guides under `agent_docs/`? → `agent_docs/Doc_Bootstrap_Guide.md`
- Load `docs/Canonical_Spec.md`, the narrative doc (`Overview.md`/`README.md`), and `Implementation_Plan.md` on‑demand when you need to verify behavior, check Anchors, or understand contracts—not automatically for every task.
- **No mixed-mode heuristics:** For tasks that span multiple modes (for example, spec + code), rely on user-specified guides via `@agent_docs/...` or a single clarifying question instead of inferring multi-stage workflows (for example, Strategy then Coding) yourself.
- **When to ask:** Only ask "Which mode should I use?" when the task is genuinely ambiguous (for example, "improve the system" with no file mentioned). If the user mentions specific files, infer the mode from file type per the Quick routing rules above instead of asking repeatedly.

### Micro-Beading (Canonical Trigger)

- **Purpose:** Use `agent_docs/micro_beading_pattern.md` to keep multi-step, load-bearing work small and explicit. **Summary:** break large work into beads (extract current state → surface TODOs → implement → check).
- **When to consider micro-beading (any):**
  - 4+ code files included for one feature/refactor, or
  - 2+ spec/plan sections modified for one behavior across the narrative doc (`Overview.md`/`README.md`), `docs/Canonical_Spec.md`, and/or `Implementation_Plan.md`, or
  - Core subsystem/API design under Co-founder stance (see §1 in `agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md`).
- **Skip micro-beading when (any):**
  - ≤3 files in one area, or
  - Small doc edits (typos, wording, ≤3 sentences), or
  - One-off bug fixes that don't alter contracts/persistence/safety.
- **Default posture:** If a change feels multi-step and load-bearing and you are unsure, prefer using micro-beading once rather than silently skipping it. Do not repeatedly re-bead the same feature unless the user explicitly asks for a deeper design pass.

### 🔴 Trigger: Editing, Writing, or Strategy
- **Condition:** User asks to design features, ask "how/why", review/audit `docs/Canonical_Spec.md` or the narrative doc, process external feedback about these docs, or edit them.
- **Action:** Load **`agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md`**.
- **Mode:** **STRATEGY Mode** (Explore options, but do not change code yet). For Bootstrap vs Stable Mode, see §2.5. For `/docs` guides, also consult `agent_docs/Doc_Bootstrap_Guide.md`.
- **For feedback-driven doc work:** Before proposing changes, apply `agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md` §2.2.1 (Feedback Triage); output at minimum the `Category` and `Decision` for each item.
- **For major refactors:** When changes span multiple spec sections or core APIs, skim **`agent_docs/Cross_Cutting_Concerns.md`** and follow §2.3 in `agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md`.
- **For new or changed core subsystems/APIs (co‑founder mode):**
  - Before drafting or rewriting spec text for a major subsystem/API, propose at least two viable design options with trade‑offs and a clear recommendation, following the Co-founder stance rules in §1 of `agent_docs/Documentation_Standards.md`.
  - **Micro-beading:** When designing a core subsystem/API, you **SHOULD** use the **Micro-Beading (Canonical Trigger)** above to structure the design work.
  - Call out when a user‑proposed design conflicts with stated goals or existing invariants, and suggest the design that best balances Safety, Simplicity, and Velocity when appropriate.
- **Doc feedback (self‑evolving docs):**
  - After a non‑trivial task, if you encounter repeated or load‑bearing friction following a guide or spec as described in the Doc Feedback Protocol in `agent_docs/Doc_Bootstrap_Guide.md`, you may surface a short doc‑improvement suggestion to the user and log it to `self-iprov.md`.
  - Do **not** edit docs proactively in this mode; only draft or apply doc diffs when the user explicitly asks for them.

### 🔵 Trigger: Coding & Implementation
- **Condition:** User asks for code or fixes, or includes tests in the same request as code.
- **Action:** Load **`agent_docs/Coding_Guidelines.md`** as your primary guide; if it is missing, stop and surface a configuration error instead of coding without guidelines.
- **Stack follow-up:** After loading the coding guide, load the relevant stack guide when applicable (for example `agent_docs/stacks/wordpress.md` for WordPress/PHP tasks).
- **Mode:** **EDIT Mode** (Strict adherence to Spec).
- **Reference:** Load `docs/Canonical_Spec.md` on‑demand when you need to verify behavior, check an invariant, or reference an Anchor by name; do not load it automatically for every small or cosmetic change.
- **Micro-beading:** When a coding task meets the **Micro-Beading (Canonical Trigger)** above, you **SHOULD** use `agent_docs/micro_beading_pattern.md` (beads → questions/TODOs → implement → check). For local ≤3-file changes that do not meet the trigger, you may skip micro-beading and simply reference the relevant spec Anchors in your summary.

### 🟡 Trigger: Test-Only Work
- **Condition:** User explicitly focuses on test design, coverage, or debugging tests without requesting code changes.
- **Action:** Load **`agent_docs/Test_Guidelines.md`** as your primary guide for this task.
- **Mode:** **VERIFY Mode** (tests are code that enforce spec invariants).
- **Reference:** Load `docs/Canonical_Spec.md` on‑demand when you need to verify spec behavior, invariants, or Anchors; consult the coding guide only when the testing guide or user explicitly calls for it.
- **Precedence:** If both 🔵 and 🟡 could match a request, prefer 🔵.
### Verification Protocol
- **Tracking method:** Track verification via completed tasks in `Implementation_Plan.md`. Each load‑bearing behavior or feature SHOULD have at least one task that links it to the relevant spec section(s) and Anchors by name and to the tests that exercise it (for example, `[x] Implement feature X (Spec: <Section Name> – Anchors: [ANCHOR_NAME]) – Verified via tests/test_feature_x.py`).
- **When claiming verification:** Do not claim behavior is "verified" unless (1) you have reasoned through the current implementation against `docs/Canonical_Spec.md`, (2) there is explicit test coverage for the load‑bearing path or clearly documented test debt in `Implementation_Plan.md`, and (3) the corresponding plan task is marked complete with a short "Verified via …" note.
- **Stale detection:** When editing `docs/Canonical_Spec.md`, for each changed spec section or Anchor name, search `Implementation_Plan.md` for that section/Anchor; uncheck or add "Re‑verify …" tasks for any affected items until tests and behavior have been updated to match the new spec.
- **Human review:** Human review is required before production deployment for any load‑bearing change, regardless of tags, comments, or plan status.

## 4. Output & Patch Standards
*Strictly follow these rules when presenting patch/diff proposals to prevent UI mangling in chat.*

- **Single Artifact:** Consolidate ALL proposed changes into a **single** code block. Do not fragment the diff into multiple snippets interspersed with commentary.
- **Patch Format:** Use **Unified Diff** (`diff`) format.
  - Use `+` for additions and `-` for removals.
  - Include 2-3 lines of context around changes.
- **Nesting Safety:** If your diff contains Markdown code fences (e.g., inside a Markdown file), you MUST **escape** the inner fences so they do not break the chat UI.
  - *Rule:* Write `\`\`\`` (escaped) instead of ` ``` ` (raw) for the inner blocks.
  - *Example:* "Change the block to start with `\`\`\`typescript`."
- **Diff-first iteration:** When the user asks you to work on a saved diff file (for example `docv2.diff`), treat that diff as the only editable artifact. Do not modify the target files mentioned in the diff until the user explicitly asks to apply/merge that diff.

### Diff-only protocol (apply-clean + UI-truthfulness)
- **Diff-only definition:** If the user says “diff-only” (or points you at a `*.diff` file to edit), the `*.diff` file is the only writable artifact for the task.
- **No hidden writes:** In diff-only tasks, do not modify the target files referenced by the diff, and do not create “scratch” files unless explicitly necessary.
- **Scratch files (if truly unavoidable):** Put them under a clearly-temporary path (e.g. `.codex_tmp/…`) and remove them in the same step; expect some UIs to still report churn if a file existed briefly.
- **Machine-applyable diffs:** Do not put prose/notes inside a `*.diff` file; keep it strictly patch content so it can be applied by standard tooling.
- **Must-check apply:** Before finalizing a diff-only change, validate it applies cleanly to the current workspace state using a dry-run (prefer `git apply --check <file>.diff`; otherwise use `patch --dry-run`), and fix the diff until it passes or explicitly report that it fails and why.
- **Must-report artifacts:** In the final response, explicitly state which file(s) were edited (e.g. “edited `a.diff` only”), whether any target files were modified/applied, and whether the dry-run apply check passed.
